# LGBTQ-PwnPC
## A LGBTQ multiple task OSINT exploitation tool

This tool is a pentesting amateur tool (more like newbie :D) that is made for people to test it for hacking and stuff.
It can be run with ```python3 pwnpc.py``` but more recommended with Sudo or as admin like ```sudo python3 pwnpc.py``` or ```sudo su``` then ```python3 pwnpc.py```
Also, even if this tool isn't good and might be better in future, I am not responsible on misuse of this tool if u have malicious purpose

## For who is it for?
It is made for hacking students, penetration testers and more especially, LGBTQ+ hackers ^w^
## What does it have in
We have these things here:
    Port Scanners (In development);
    Stresser DoS (In correction and in exploits section);
    QR Code generator (In social engineering section);
(I forgot to add more, but I will when I update more stuff in the tool :D)

### Contributions
If u want to contribute, collab, or anything, I am totally accepting :3
It will make the tool better and I am happy for those contributions, but do not skid my tool
